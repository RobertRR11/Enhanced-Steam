# Enhanced Steam (WIP)

A browser extension that modernizes the Steam UI based on Valve's latest design changes.
This is a work in progress, not much is implemented yet, many things are planned.
Most of the code (including css) right now is just a concept and not yet ready for publishing as downloadable extension.

### Current features are:
- Redesigned age verification page
- Redesigned game page (WIP)
- Redesigned achievement and game lists (WIP)
- New "on wishlist" and "in library" banners
- Modern scrollbars, buttons and more based on other newer pages

### Planned:
- Make game page use the full screen width
- Improve other parts of game page (for example if the content is geoblocked or the achievements page)
- Improve the video player
- Redesign the dumpster fire that is steamcommunity
- Add a option menu to toggle specific features or pages
